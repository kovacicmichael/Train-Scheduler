# Welcome to Train-Scheduler
Train-Sceduler uses firebase to create an application that keeps track of train arrival times.

***

## Overview
Train-Scheduler connects to a firebase database where it stores a variety of train information including their name, destination, initial departure time, and departure frequency.  On the site, the user may add a new train in the provided form.  The form intakes the information mentioned above and pushes it to the database.  Upon the new submition, the information is then displayed on the page along with its calculated next arrival time and minutes away.
